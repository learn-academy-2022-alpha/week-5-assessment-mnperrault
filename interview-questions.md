# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in Ruby is a chunk of code encased in curly braces or a do-ends statement, and is invoked from a function with the same name as the block.

  Researched answer: A block in Ruby is considered an anonymous function that can be passed into methods using curly braces {} or a do-end statement. The curly braces {} are used for single line block while the do-end state is typcially used for blocks that extend through mutiple lines.

2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: Gems are open source libraries which contain Ruby code and is a package manager.

  Researched answer: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language. It provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"). The gem command is used to build, upload, download, and install Gem packages.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.

  Researched answer: Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. It provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. Experienced developers report that it makes web app development more fun as well as being easier to start with.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is one that stores data in rows and fields. The relationship between tables and field types is called a schema.

  Researched answer: A relational database links information from multiple tables through the use of "keys". A key is a unique identifier which can be assigned to a row of data contained within a table. This unique identifier, called a "primary key," can then be included in a record located in another table. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it's the language that relational databases are written in. It is used to execute queries, retrieve data, and edit data by updating, deleting, or creating new records.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are important because they help construct a database.

  Researched answer: Primary keys are pointer to physical data on disk or in memory. For example, If you come to library with thousands of book, you should tell the book name and author. This is your PK in real life. Databases are developed based on this premise for fast access to large sets of data.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful path depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is an open standard file and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects. It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with server-side access.

3. ERB: Using ERB, actual Ruby code can be added to any plain text document for the purposes of generating document information details and/or flow control. ERB provides an easy to use but powerful templating system for Ruby documents in a variety of different languages.

4. Params: Params refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request. params comes from Action Controller::Base, which is accessed by your application via Application Controller. As you might have guessed, this is an alias for the parameters method in the same way as the previous method.

5. API: API is the  set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
